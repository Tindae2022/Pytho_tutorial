    "## Stack implementation\n",
    "A common and basic method of implementing stacks is to make use of another\n",
    "fundamental data structure, namely, arrays. While arrays are sequential data\n",
    "structures, the other alternative of employing linked data structures has been\n",
    "successfully attempted and applied. This is fairly\n",
    "convenient considering the fact that stacks are one-dimensional ordered lists and so\n",
    "are arrays, which, despite their multidimensional structure, are inherently associated\n",
    "with a one-dimensional consecutive set of memory locations (Chapter 3).\n",
    "Figure 4.3 shows a stack of four elements R, S, V, and G represented by an array\n",
    "STACK[1:7]. In general, if a stack is represented as an array STACK[1:n], then n\n",
    "elements and not one more can be stored in the stack. It therefore becomes essential\n",
    "to issue a signal or warning termed STACK_FULL when elements whose number\n",
    "is over and above n are pushed into the stack.\n",
    "Again, during a pop operation, it is essential to ensure that one does not delete an\n",
    "empty stack! Hence, the necessity for a signal or a warning termed\n",
    "**STACK_EMPTY** during the implementation of the pop operation. While\n",
    "implementation of stacks using arrays necessitates checking for STACK_FULL/\n",
    "**STACK_EMPTY** conditions during push/pop operations, the implementation of\n",

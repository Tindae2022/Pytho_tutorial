    "## Tutorial on Order of Growth in Time Complexity in Python\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "When analyzing algorithms, one crucial aspect to consider is their efficiency in terms of time and space usage. Time complexity deals with understanding how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. Order of growth is a way to express this growth rate, providing valuable insights into an algorithm's scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll focus on understanding the concept of order of growth and how to determine it for various Python algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Big O Notation\n",
    "The Big O notation is commonly used to represent the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. It provides a simple and concise way to express how an algorithm's runtime grows relative to the size of its input. In Big O notation, we use O(f(n)) to denote the upper bound, where f(n) represents the rate of growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common Big O notations along with examples of their typical algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "O(1) - Constant Time: The algorithm's runtime remains constant, regardless of the input size. Example: Accessing an element from an array by its index.\n",
    "O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: The algorithm's runtime grows logarithmically with the input size. Example: Binary search in a sorted list.\n",
    "O(n) - Linear Time: The algorithm's runtime grows linearly with the input size. Example: Searching for an element in an unsorted list.\n",
    "O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: The algorithm's runtime grows in between linear and logarithmic time. Example: Merge sort.\n",
    "O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: The algorithm's runtime grows quadratically with the input size. Example: Selection sort.\n",
    "O(n^3) - Cubic Time: The algorithm's runtime grows cubically with the input size. Example: Matrix multiplication using nested loops.\n",
    "O(2^n) - Exponential Time: The algorithm's runtime grows exponentially with the input size. Example: Generating all subsets of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determining Time Complexity in Python\n",
    "To determine the time complexity of a Python algorithm, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Identify the Input Size\n",
    "Understand what the input size is for your algorithm. For example, in a list sorting algorithm, the input size is the length of the list n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Count Basic Operations\n",
    "Count the number of basic operations executed by the algorithm as a function of the input size. Basic operations can be assignments, comparisons, arithmetic operations, function calls, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Find Dominant Terms\n",
    "Identify the dominant term(s) that contribute the most to the total number of operations. Ignore lower-order terms and constant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Express Time Complexity Using Big O Notation\n",
    "Express the time complexity using Big O notation, based on the dominant terms. This provides a concise representation of the algorithm's growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examples\n",

    "In this tutorial, we'll explore logarithmic time complexity in the context of algorithms and programming in Python. We'll start with an explanation of logarithms and how they relate to time complexity. Then, we'll cover various examples of algorithms with logarithmic time complexity, along with step-by-step explanations for each example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Logarithmic Time Complexity?\n",
    "Logarithmic time complexity, often denoted as O(log n), is a time complexity that occurs when the execution time of an algorithm decreases logarithmically as the size of the input (n) increases. In simpler terms, when an algorithm has logarithmic time complexity, its performance improves dramatically as the input size grows larger. Algorithms with logarithmic time complexity are generally considered highly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic time complexity typically arises in algorithms that divide the input into smaller portions in each step, resulting in a significant reduction of data to process with each iteration. Common examples of algorithms with logarithmic time complexity include binary search and certain divide-and-conquer algorithms.\n",

    "## Examples of Logarithmic Time Complexity\n",

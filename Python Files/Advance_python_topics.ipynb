    "## 3 scenarios on when to use named tuple when coding an application\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structures: Namedtuples are useful when you need to represent structured data that consists of multiple fields. For example, if you are working with a collection of 2D points in an application, using a named tuple like Point(x, y) would provide a clear and concise way to represent each point's coordinates. It enhances code readability and self-documentation, making it easier to understand and maintain your data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Operations: When interacting with databases, namedtuples can be used to handle query results or database records. Instead of accessing data by indices or arbitrary column names, you can use namedtuples to give meaningful names to each field in the record. This makes the code more readable and reduces the chances of errors when working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration Settings: Namedtuples can be utilized when managing application configurations. Rather than using dictionaries or plain tuples, namedtuples provide a more structured and self-explanatory way to define configuration settings. Each field can represent a specific aspect of the configuration, such as database credentials, API keys, or file paths. This approach makes it easier to access and manipulate configuration values throughout the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, namedtuples are beneficial in scenarios where you want to enhance code readability, improve data structure understanding, and provide self-documenting code by associating meaningful names with different parts of your application's logic or data."
